# To-Do-List-Hooks

Welcome to my To-do List (Hooks Version)! This application is my introduction into learning React Hooks while acting as a refresher for my MySQL skills. All you need to do is type in an item (or action) you are planning along with the quantity. Once you hit submit, the entry will be added to the list! There are already a few sample items loaded into the database and you can update and/or delete them as you like.

Goals

- Utilize React Hooks
- Use MySQL as a database
- Implement TDD
